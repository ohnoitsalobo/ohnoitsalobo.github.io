                <h4>
                    How does the LCM-01 Microphone work?
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The microphone operates using a phenomenon called piezoelectricity – this is the generation of electricity when a material bends or moves. Using a disc of piezoelectric material, the vibrations of your acoustic instrument are converted into an electrical signal that can be amplified by a PA speaker or mixer.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    What’s special about this microphone?
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Unlike common instrument pickups, this microphone produces a “balanced” audio signal similar to vocal microphones – in non-technical terms, this means that it is highly resistant to electrical interference or noise, which can often be heard as a ‘buzzing’ or humming sound from typical instrument pickups.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to take advantage of this noise immunity, you must use the correct audio cable, which should be included with your purchase – a standard instrument cable will not be resistant to noise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, the LCM-01 Microphone is designed to be used in conjunction with the LPP-01 Piezoelectric Preamplifier, which is also hand-built by yours truly. The preamplifier acts to improve the sound of the piezoelectric microphone, when connected to a mixer. It can be used without the preamplifier, but sound quality will suffer.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    The LPP-01 Piezoelectric Preamplifier
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Piezoelectric microphones are simple but special devices, such that common sound systems are not designed to handle them directly. As an analogy, think of trying to drive a pickup truck using the engine of a motorcycle; you’ll move, but neither the truck nor the engine are well suited to each other. This incompatibility can be heard when cheap piezoelectric microphones are used in music shows; instruments will tend to sound unnatural, sounding very ‘sharp’ and ‘tinny’ as though they’re being played through a metal box.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hence, the LPP-01 Preamplifier module is designed specifically for this microphone, in order to capture the best possible sound. It acts as a buffer between the microphone and a PA system, preventing any incompatibility and thus preserving the natural sound of the instrument.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The preamplifier module requires power to work, which is provided by 48V ‘phantom power’ available on all professional sound systems.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Usage
                </h4>
                <p>
                    • For basic usage, the microphone can be connected to any common sound system using a standard instrument cable (TS, or tip-sleeve jack). <br />
                    • To improve noise immunity, use a ‘stereo’ jack (also known as TRS, or tip-ring-sleeve) to connect to a mixer. <br />
                    • For the best performance, connect the contact microphone to the preamplifier module using the provided custom cable, and connect the preamplifier to a mixer using a standard XLR microphone cable. <br />
                    (Pro tip: Make sure phantom power is turned on for the preamplifier to work!)
