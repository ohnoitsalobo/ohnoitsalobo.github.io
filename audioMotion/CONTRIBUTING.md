# Contributing

!> Please note that this is a hobby project that I work on in my free time.

- If you want to send some feedback or ask a question, please drop me an e-mail at hvianna@gmail.com
- If you have a feature request, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/hvianna/audioMotion-analyzer/issues)
- If you want to submit a Pull Request, please branch it off the project's `develop` branch - that makes it easier for me to incorporate your changes in a future release.
