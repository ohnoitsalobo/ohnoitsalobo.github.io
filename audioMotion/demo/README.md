# audioMotion-analyzer demos

The demos need to be loaded through a web server, due to CORS restrictions on media files and JavaScript module security requirements.

If you have npm installed, just run `npm start` in the project's folder and open http://localhost:8080/demo in your browser.

You can also try the [online demos](https://audiomotion.dev/demo) or play with the [live demos on Codepen](https://codepen.io/collection/ABbbKr).
