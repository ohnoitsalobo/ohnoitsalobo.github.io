Changelog
=========

## version 3.6.0 (2021-10-10)

### Added: <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

+ [`alphaBars`](README.md#alphabars-boolean) effect, which is similar to `lumiBars` but preserves bars' amplitudes and also works on discrete frequencies mode and radial visualization;
+ [`outlineBars`](README.md#outlinebars-boolean) effect, which extends the usage of `lineWidth` and `fillAlpha` to octave bands modes;
+ [`isAlphaBars`](README.md#isalphabars-boolean-read-only) and [`isOutlineBars`](README.md#isoutlinebars-boolean-read-only) read-only properties.

### Changed: <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

+ `showLeds` and `isLedDisplay` **have been deprecated** in favor of [`ledBars`](README.md#ledbars-boolean) and [`isLedBars`](README.md#isledbars-boolean-read-only), for consistent naming of effects.

### Added: <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

+ [`getEnergy()`](README.md#getenergy-preset-startfreq-endfreq-) method - see it in action on [this pen](https://codepen.io/hvianna/pen/poNmVYo) - thanks **@Staijn1** for [suggesting this feature](https://github.com/hvianna/audioMotion.js/issues/12#issuecomment-733045035);

### Improvements: <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

+ When passing an AudioNode in the `source` property of constructor, it's no longer necessary to explicitly provide the `audioCtx`, as it will be inferred from the source node - thanks [@evoyy](https://github.com/evoyy) for this idea;
+ Disconnecting the output from the speakers no longer prevents the analyzer from working on Chromium-based browsers;
+ Expose the `GradientOptions` TypeScript interface for user scripts (props to [@Staijn1](https://github.com/Staijn1));
+ Improved the look of the LEDs effect in very small containers (like in the [multi-instance demo](https://audiomotion.dev/demo/multi.html)), especially when `loRes` is active;
+ Refactored some code for improved legibility, performance and file size (still below 20kB minified! :sunglasses:);
+ Added compatibility with *standardized-audio-context* library - thanks [@richclingman](https://github.com/richclingman) for reporting this issue.

### Changed: <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

+ Generate only the currently selected gradient on mode/gradient changes.


## version 3.0.0 (2020-11-28)

### BREAKING CHANGES: <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

+ The `analyzer` object is no longer exposed - use the new [`connectInput()`](README.md#connectinput-source-) method to connect all audio sources and [`connectOutput()`](README.md#connectoutput-node-) to connect the analyzer output to other nodes;
+ `audioSource` property has been renamed to [`connectedSources`](README.md#connectedsources-array), which now returns an **array** of all connected audio sources;
+ `binToFreq()` and `freqToBin()` methods have been removed;
+ `connectAudio()` method has been replaced by [`connectInput()`](README.md#connectinput-source-), which now accepts either an HTML media element or any instance of AudioNode;
+ `dataArray` property is no longer exposed;
+ `showScale` property has been renamed to [`showScaleX`](README.md#showscalex-boolean);
+ `version` is now a **static** property and should always be accessed as [`AudioMotionAnalyzer.version`](README.md#audiomotionanalyzerversion-string-read-only).

### New features: <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

+ Dual channel (stereo) analyzer option;
+ Built-in volume control;
+ New methods for easy connection/disconnection of input and output nodes:
  + [`connectInput()`](README.md#connectinput-source-)
  + [`disconnectInput()`](README.md#disconnectinput-node-)
  + [`connectOutput()`](README.md#connectoutput-node-)
  + [`disconnectOutput()`](README.md#disconnectoutput-node-)
+ New properties:
  + [`isOctaveBands`](README.md#isoctavebands-boolean-read-only) (read only)
  + [`isLedDisplay`](README.md#isleddisplay-boolean-read-only) (read only)
  + [`isLumiBars`](README.md#islumibars-boolean-read-only) (read only)
  + [`stereo`](README.md#stereo-boolean)
  + [`splitGradient`](README.md#splitgradient-boolean)
  + [`volume`](README.md#volume-number)

### Improvements: <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

+ Automatically unlock/resume the AudioContext on first user click, so you don't need to handle this in your code anymore;
+ Improved FFT data interpolation on low frequencies (especially noticeable in 1/12th and 1/24th octave bands);
+ Corrected initial amplitude of line / area graph.

### Fixed: <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

+ A compatibility issue that could cause `reflexRatio` not to work in some environments.


## version 2.5.0 (2020-10-07)

### Improvements: <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

+ Behavior of the [`onCanvasResize`](README.md#oncanvasresize-function) callback is now consistent across different browsers. Changes worth of note:
  1. on fullscreen changes, **only a `'fschange'` *reason* will be reported** to the callback function - no more redundant `'resize'` calls;
  2. the callback function is now executed **only when canvas dimensions effectively change** from the previous state - for example,
  setting [`loRes`](README.md#lores-boolean) or [`width`](README.md#width-number) to the same value they already have won't trigger a callback;
+ Canvas dimensions are now properly updated whenever the container element is resized, not only on window resize;
+ [`audioSource`](README.md#audiosource-mediaelementaudiosourcenode-object) now returns the first audio source connected via [`connectAudio()`](README.md#connectaudio-element-)
  method, if no source was provided during instantiation;
+ Size of scale labels on both axes is now scaled relatively to the canvas height;
+ Added a [new demo](https://audiomotion.dev/demo) with only the minimal code required to use audioMotion-analyzer;
+ Demo scripts are now loaded as native ES6 modules and no longer require bundling. See the [README file](demo/README.md) for instructions on running the demos locally.


## version 2.4.0 (2020-07-18)

### Added: <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

+ New **Radial** visualization - see [`radial`](README.md#radial-boolean) and [`spinSpeed`](README.md#spinspeed-number) properties and try them in the [demos](https://audiomotion.dev/demo)! - thanks **@inglesuniversal** for [suggesting this feature](https://github.com/hvianna/audioMotion.js/issues/6);
+ [`showScaleY`](README.md#showscaley-boolean) property for displaying the level (dB) scale on the analyzer's vertical axis;
+ [`energy`](README.md#energy-number-read-only) and [`peakEnergy`](README.md#peakenergy-number-read-only) read-only properties;
+ [Known issues](README.md#known-issues) section added to the documentation.

### Changed: <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

+ [`setOptions()`](README.md#setoptions-options-) called with no argument now **resets all configuration options to their default values** (it used to raise an error);
+ The LED effect code has been refactored to improve appearance and compatibility with other (future) effects;
+ "Unlit" LEDs are no longer displayed in **overlay mode** - see the notice in [`showBgColor`](README.md#showbgcolor-boolean) documentation;
+ Canvas `fillStyle` and `strokeStyle` properties are now set with the current gradient before calling the [`onCanvasDraw`](README.md#oncanvasdraw-function) callback function;
+ Updated all [demos](https://audiomotion.dev/demo) with more straightforward access to configuration options.


## version 2.3.0 (2020-06-08)

### Added: <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

+ [`binToFreq()`](README.md#bintofreq-bin-) and [`freqToBin()`](README.md#freqtobin-frequency-rounding-) methods;
+ [`reflexBright`](README.md#reflexbright-number) property, which allows to adjust the brightness of the reflected image.

### Changed: <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

+ Reverted the change to `reflexAlpha` introduced in [v2.2.1](https://github.com/hvianna/audioMotion-analyzer/releases/tag/2.2.1)
+ Removed the forced black layer off the reflection background.


## version 2.2.1 (2020-05-31)

### Changed: <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

+ ~~Improved the Reflex effect in [`overlay`](README.md#overlay-boolean) mode - the [`reflexAlpha`](README.md#reflexalpha-number) property is
now used to adjust the opacity of a dark layer applied *over* the reflection area, which prevents undesired transparency of the reflection itself
and creates a consistent effect, whether overlay mode is on or off~~ **(reverted in v2.3.0)**;

+ The package source code has been moved from the `dist` to the `src` folder.

### Fixed: <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

+ Prevent showing leds below the 0 level, when both reflex and overlay are active.


## version 2.2.0 (2020-05-19)

### Added: <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

+ New [`overlay`](README.md#overlay-boolean) and [`bgAlpha`](README.md#bgalpha-number) properties allow displaying the analyzer over other contents.
[Check out the new demo!](https://audiomotion.dev/demo/overlay.html)

### Changed: <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

+ Corrected the documentation for the [`registerGradient()`](README.md#registergradient-name-options-) method, which stated the `bgColor` property was required (it has always been optional).


## version 2.1.0 (2020-04-06)

### Added: <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

+ Customizable Reflex effect - see [`reflexRatio`](README.md#reflexratio-number) and try it in the [demo](https://audiomotion.dev/demo/fluid.html).


## version 2.0.0 (2020-03-24)

### Added: <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

+ New [`lineWidth`](README.md#linewidth-number) and [`fillAlpha`](README.md#fillalpha-number) properties for [mode 10](README.md#mode-number) customization, so it can now work as an area graph (default), a line graph or a combination of both;
+ New [`barSpace`](README.md#barspace-number) property for customizable bar spacing in octave bands modes;
+ You can now provide an external AudioContext via `audioCtx` property in the [constructor's `options`](README.md#constructor), allowing you to share the same context among different instances;
+ Custom [error codes](README.md#custom-errors);
+ New [`version`](README.md#version-string-read-only) property;

### Changed: <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

+ Increased default spacing between bars in octave bands modes - to get the previous look, set [`barSpace`](README.md#barspace-number) to **1**;
+ Improved accuracy when positioning the X-axis scale labels in octave bands modes;
+ Slightly improved vertical usage of canvas when the LED effect is active (removed the black line at the bottom of the screen);
+ Canvas context is now saved before calling the user callback function and restored afterwards, to avoid undesirable changes;
+ Several functions were refactored for improved legibility, memory usage and performance;
+ Improved documentation and demos;

### Fixed: <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

+ The multi-instance demo should now work on browsers other than Firefox (it now uses a shared audio context);
+ `isFullscreen` property now correctly reads `false` (instead of `undefined`) when the analyzer is not in fullscreen (*potentially breaking change*);
+ Setting one of the callback functions to `undefined` with `setOptions()` now properly unregisters the callback (*potentially breaking change*);

### API breaking changes: <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

+ `audioCtx`, `analyzer`, `canvas` and `canvasCtx` objects are now read-only (`canvasCtx` properties may be safely modified while inside the callback for `onCanvasDraw`);
+ `frame` and `time` properties are not exposed anymore, as they are intended for internal use only;
+ `registerGradient()` method now enforces the `name` argument being a non-empty `string` (throws an [error](README.md#custom-errors) otherwise);
+ Errors now return a custom object and some error messages have changed - use the new [`code` property](README.md#custom-errors) to identify errors in a reliable way.


## version 1.2.0 (2019-12-19)

+ Improves the look of bars at lower frequencies in octave bands modes (especially 1/12th and 1/24th);
+ Minor tweak to the "Rainbow" gradient to make cyan and blue shades a little more balanced.


## version 1.1.0 (2019-12-08)

+ New **Area fill** visualization mode (`mode: 10`), which uses the same full-frequency data of the *discrete frequencies* mode, but generates a brighter filled shape;
+ New **Luminance Bars** option (`lumiBars: <boolean>`) for octave bands modes, which displays analyzer bars always at full-height, with varying luminance instead.


## version 1.0.1 (2019-10-22)

+ Minor cleanup to optimize npm package size.


## version 1.0.0 (2019-10-07)

+ First stable release.


## version 1.0.0-rc.1 (2019-10-05)

+ Release candidate for v1.0.0
