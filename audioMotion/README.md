## About

**audioMotion-analyzer** is a high-resolution real-time audio spectrum analyzer built upon **Web Audio** and **Canvas** JavaScript APIs.

It was originally conceived as part of a full-featured music player called [**audioMotion**](https://audiomotion.me), but I later decided to make just
the spectrum analyzer available as a self-contained module, so other developers could use it in their own projects.

My goal is to make this the best looking, most accurate and customizable spectrum analyzer around, in a small-footprint and high-performance package.

## Usage

### Native ES6 module (ESM)

Load from Skypack CDN:

```html
<script type="module">
  import AudioMotionAnalyzer from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/audiomotion-analyzer?min';
  // your code here
</script>
```

Or download the [latest version](https://github.com/hvianna/audioMotion-analyzer/releases) and copy the `audioMotion-analyzer.js` file from the `src/` folder into your project folder.

### npm project

Install as a dependency:

```console
$ npm i --save audiomotion-analyzer
```

Use ES6 import syntax:

```js
import AudioMotionAnalyzer from 'audiomotion-analyzer';
```

## Constructor

`new AudioMotionAnalyzer( [container], [{options}] )`

Creates a new instance of **audioMotion-analyzer**.

The analyzer canvas will be appended to the HTML element referenced by `container`, unless you set [`useCanvas: false`](#usecanvas-boolean) in the options.

If `container` is undefined, the document's body will be used instead.

Usage example:

```js
const audioMotion = new AudioMotionAnalyzer(
	document.getElementById('container'),
	{
		source: document.getElementById('audio')
	}
);
```

This will insert the analyzer canvas inside the *#container* element and start the visualization of audio coming from the *#audio* element.

### Options object

### Constructor-specific options

#### `audioCtx` *AudioContext object*

*Available since v2.0.0*

Allows you to provide an external [*AudioContext*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioContext)
for **audioMotion-analyzer**, for connection with other Web Audio nodes or sound-processing modules.

Since version 3.2.0, `audioCtx` will be automatically inferred from the [`source`](#source-htmlmediaelement-or-audionode-object) property if that's an *AudioNode*.

If neither is defined, a new audio context will be created. After instantiation, [`audioCtx`](#audioctx-audiocontext-object-read-only) will be available as a read-only property.

See [this live code](https://codesandbox.io/s/9y6qb) and the [multi-instance demo](/demo/multi.html) for more usage examples.

#### `connectSpeakers` *boolean*

*Available since v3.2.0*

Whether or not to connect the analyzer output to the speakers (technically, the *AudioContext* `destination` node).

Some scenarios where you may want to set this to `false`:

1. when running multiple instances of **audioMotion-analyzer** sharing the same audio input (see the [multi demo](/demo/multi.html)),
only one of them needs to be connected to the speakers, otherwise the volume will be amplified due to multiple outputs;
1. when audio input comes from the microphone and you're not using headphones, to prevent a feedback loop from the speakers;
1. when you're using **audioMotion-analyzer** with an audio player which already outputs sound to the speakers (same reason as 1).

After instantiation, use [`connectOutput()`](#connectoutput-node-) and [`disconnectOutput()`](#disconnectoutput-node-) to connect or disconnect the output from the speakers (or other nodes).

Defaults to **true**.

See also [`connectedTo`](#connectedto-array-read-only).

#### `fsElement` *HTMLElement object*

*Available since v3.4.0*

HTML element affected by the [`toggleFullscreen()`](#togglefullscreen) method.

If not defined, defaults to the [`canvas`](#canvas-htmlcanvaselement-object-read-only).
**Set it to a container `<div>` to keep additional interface elements available in fullscreen mode.**

See the [overlay demo](/demo/overlay.html) or [this pen](https://codepen.io/hvianna/pen/LYREBYQ) for usage examples.

After instantiation, [`fsElement`](#fselement-htmlelement-object-read-only) is available as a read-only property.

#### `source` *HTMLMediaElement or AudioNode object*

If `source` is specified, connects an [*HTMLMediaElement*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement) object (an `<audio>` or `<video>` HTML tag)
or any instance of [*AudioNode*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioNode) to the analyzer.

At least one audio source is required for the analyzer to work. You can also connect audio sources after instantiation, using the [`connectInput()`](#connectinput-source-) method.

#### `start` *boolean*

If `start: false` is specified, the analyzer will be created stopped. You can then start it with the [`toggleAnalyzer()`](#toggleanalyzer-boolean-) method.

Defaults to **true**, so the analyzer will start running right after initialization.

## Properties

### `alphaBars` *boolean*

*Available since v3.6.0*

When set to *true* each bar's amplitude affects its opacity, i.e., higher bars are rendered more opaque while shorter bars are more transparent.

This is similar to the [`lumiBars`](#lumibars-boolean) effect, but bars' amplitudes are preserved and it also works on **Discrete** [mode](#mode-number) and [radial](#radial-boolean) visualization.

For effect priority when combined with other settings, see [`isAlphaBars`](#isalphabars-boolean-read-only).

Defaults to **false**.

!> [See related known issue](#alphabars-and-fillalpha-wont-work-with-radial-on-firefox)

### `audioCtx` *AudioContext object* *(Read only)*

[*AudioContext*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioContext) used by **audioMotion-analyzer**.

Use this object to create additional audio sources to be connected to the analyzer, like oscillator nodes, gain nodes and media streams.

The code fragment below creates an oscillator and a gain node using audioMotion's *AudioContext*, and then connects them to the analyzer:

```js
const audioMotion = new AudioMotionAnalyzer( document.getElementById('container') ),
      audioCtx    = audioMotion.audioCtx,
      oscillator  = audioCtx.createOscillator(),
      gainNode    = audioCtx.createGain();

oscillator.frequency.value = 440; // set 440Hz frequency
oscillator.connect( gainNode ); // connect oscillator -> gainNode

gainNode.gain.value = .5; // set volume to 50%
audioMotion.connectInput( gainNode ); // connect gainNode -> audioMotion

oscillator.start(); // play tone
```

You can provide your own *AudioContext* via the [`audioCtx`](#audioctx-audiocontext-object) property in the [constructor](#constructor) options.

See also the [fluid demo](/demo/fluid.html) and the [multi-instance demo](/demo/multi.html) for more usage examples.

### `barSpace` *number*

*Available since v2.0.0*

Customize the spacing between bars in **octave bands** [modes](#mode-number).

Use a value between 0 and 1 for spacing proportional to the band width. Values >= 1 will be considered as a literal number of pixels.

For example, `barSpace = 0.5` will use half the width available to each band for spacing and half for the bar itself.
On the other hand, `barSpace = 2` will set a fixed spacing of 2 pixels, independent of the width of bars.
Prefer proportional spacing to obtain consistent results among different resolutions and screen sizes.

`barSpace = 0` will effectively show contiguous bars, except when [`ledBars`](#ledbars-boolean) is *true*, in which case a minimum spacing is enforced
(this can be customized via [`setLedParams()`](#setledparams-params-) method).

Defaults to **0.1**.

### `bgAlpha` *number*

*Available since v2.2.0*

Controls the opacity of the background, when [`overlay`](#overlay-boolean) and [`showBgColor`](#showbgcolor-boolean) are both set to *true*.

It must be a number between 0 (completely transparent) and 1 (completely opaque).

Defaults to **0.7**.

### `canvas` *HTMLCanvasElement object* *(Read only)*

[*Canvas*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement) element created by audioMotion.

### `canvasCtx` *CanvasRenderingContext2D object* *(Read only)*

[2D rendering context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D) used for drawing in audioMotion's *Canvas*.

### `connectedSources` *array* *(Read only)*

*Available since v3.0.0*

An array of *AudioNode* objects connected to the analyzer **input** via the [`source`](#source-htmlmediaelement-or-audionode-object) constructor option, or by using the [`connectInput()`](#connectinput-source-) method.

### `connectedTo` *array* *(Read only)*

*Available since v3.2.0*

An array of *AudioNode* objects to which the analyzer **output** is connected.

By default, **audioMotion-analyzer** is connected to the *AudioContext* `destination` node (the speakers) upon instantiation, unless you set [`connectSpeakers: false`](#connectspeakers-boolean) in the constructor options.

See also [`connectOutput()`](#connectoutput-node-).

### `energy` **(DEPRECATED)**

**This property will be removed in version 4.0.0** - Use [`getEnergy()`](#getenergy-preset-startfreq-endfreq-) instead.

### `fftSize` *number*

Number of samples used for the FFT performed by the [*AnalyzerNode*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AnalyserNode).
It must be a power of 2 between 32 and 32768, so valid values are: 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, and 32768.

Higher values provide more detail in the frequency domain, but less detail in the time domain (slower response), so you may need to adjust [`smoothing`](#smoothing-number) accordingly.

Defaults to **8192**.

### `fillAlpha` *number*

*Available since v2.0.0*

Opacity of the area fill in **Graph** [mode](#mode-number), or inner fill of bars in **octave bands** modes when [`outlineBars`](#outlinebars-boolean) is *true*.

It must be a number between 0 (completely transparent) and 1 (completely opaque).

Please note that the line stroke (when [`lineWidth`](#linewidth-number) > 0) is always drawn at full opacity, regardless of the `fillAlpha` value.

Also, for octave bands modes, [`alphaBars`](#alphabars-boolean) set to *true* takes precedence over `fillAlpha`.

Defaults to **1**.

!> [See related known issue](#alphabars-and-fillalpha-wont-work-with-radial-on-firefox)

### `fps` *number* *(Read only)*

Current frame rate.

### `fsElement` *HTMLElement object* *(Read only)*

*Available since v3.4.0*

HTML element affected by the [`toggleFullscreen()`](#togglefullscreen) method.

See [`fsElement`](#fselement-htmlelement-object) in the constructor options context for more information.

### `fsHeight` *number* *(Read only)*
### `fsWidth` *number* *(Read only)*

Canvas dimensions used during fullscreen mode. These take the current pixel ratio into account and will change accordingly when [low-resolution mode](#lores-boolean) is set.

### `gradient` *string*

Currently selected color gradient used for analyzer graphs.

It must be the name of a built-in or [registered](#registergradient-name-options-) gradient. Built-in gradients are *'classic'*, *'prism'* and *'rainbow'*.

Defaults to **'classic'**.

### `height` *number*
### `width` *number*

Nominal dimensions of the analyzer.

If one or both of these are `undefined`, the analyzer will try to adjust to the container's width and/or height.
If the container's width and/or height are 0 (inline elements), a reference size of **640 x 270 pixels** will be used to replace the missing dimension(s).
This should be considered the minimum dimensions for proper visualization of all available modes with the [LED effect](#ledbars-boolean) on.

You can set both values at once using the [`setCanvasSize()`](#setcanvassize-width-height-) method.

?> You can read the actual canvas dimensions at any time directly from the [`canvas`](#canvas-htmlcanvaselement-object-read-only) object.

### `isAlphaBars` *boolean* *(Read only)*

*Available since v3.6.0*

***true*** when alpha bars are effectively being displayed, i.e., [`alphaBars`](#alphabars-boolean) is set to *true* and [`mode`](#mode-number) is set to discrete frequencies
or one of the octave bands modes, in which case [`lumiBars`](#lumibars-boolean) must be set to *false* or [`radial`](#radial-boolean) must be set to *true*.

### `isFullscreen` *boolean* *(Read only)*

***true*** when the analyzer is being displayed in fullscreen, or ***false*** otherwise.

See [`toggleFullscreen()`](#togglefullscreen).

### `isLedBars` *boolean* *(Read only)*

*Available since v3.6.0* (formerly `isLedDisplay`)

***true*** when LED bars are effectively being displayed, i.e., [`ledBars`](#ledBars-boolean) is set to *true* and [`mode`](#mode-number) is set to an octave bands mode and [`radial`](#radial-boolean) is *false*.

### `isLedDisplay` **(DEPRECATED)**

**This property will be removed in version 4.0.0** - Use [`isLedBars`](#isledbars-boolean-read-only) instead.

### `isLumiBars` *boolean* *(Read only)*

*Available since v3.0.0*

***true*** when luminance bars are effectively being displayed, i.e., [`lumiBars`](#lumibars-boolean) is set to *true* and [`mode`](#mode-number) is set to an octave bands mode and [`radial`](#radial-boolean) is *false*.

### `isOctaveBands` *boolean* *(Read only)*

*Available since v3.0.0*

***true*** when [`mode`](#mode-number) is set to one of the octave bands modes.

### `isOn` *boolean* *(Read only)*

***true*** if the analyzer process is running, or *false* if it's stopped.

See [`toggleAnalyzer()`](#toggleanalyzer-boolean-).

### `isOutlineBars` *boolean* *(Read only)*

*Available since v3.6.0*

***true*** when outlined bars are effectively being displayed, i.e., [`outlineBars`](#outlinebars-boolean) is set to *true*, [`mode`](#mode-number) is set to
one of the octave bands modes and both [`ledBars`](#ledbars-boolean) and [`lumiBars`](#lumibars-boolean) are set to *false*, or [`radial`](#radial-boolean) is set to *true*.

### `ledBars` *boolean*

*Available since v3.6.0* (formerly `showLeds`)

*true* to activate a vintage LEDs display effect. Only effective for **octave bands** [modes](#mode-number).

This effect can be customized via [`setLedParams()`](#setledparams-params-) method.

For effect priority when combined with other settings, see [`isLedBars`](#isledbars-boolean-read-only).

Defaults to **false**.

### `lineWidth` *number*

*Available since v2.0.0*

Line width for **Graph** [mode](#mode-number), or outline stroke in **octave bands** modes when [`outlineBars`](#outlinebars-boolean) is *true*.

For the line to be distinguishable, set also [`fillAlpha`](#fillalpha-number) < 1.

Defaults to **0**.

### `loRes` *boolean*

*true* for low resolution mode. Defaults to **false**.

Low resolution mode halves the effective pixel ratio, resulting in four times less pixels to render. This may improve performance significantly, especially in 4K+ monitors.

?> If you want to allow users to interactively toggle low resolution mode, you may need to set a fixed size for the canvas via CSS, like so:

```css
canvas {
    display: block;
    width: 100%;
}
```

This will prevent the canvas size from changing, when switching the low resolution mode on and off.

### `lumiBars` *boolean*

*Available since v1.1.0*

This is only effective for **octave bands** [modes](#mode-number).

When set to *true* all analyzer bars will be displayed at full height with varying luminance (opacity, actually) instead.

`lumiBars` takes precedence over [`alphaBars`](#alphabars-boolean) and [`outlineBars`](#outlinebars-boolean), except in [`radial`](#radial-boolean) visualization.

For effect priority when combined with other settings, see [`isLumiBars`](#islumibars-boolean-read-only).

Defaults to **false**.

### `maxDecibels` *number*
### `minDecibels` *number*

Highest and lowest decibel values represented in the Y-axis of the analyzer. The loudest volume possible is **0**.

You can set both values at once using the [`setSensitivity()`](#setsensitivity-mindecibels-maxdecibels-) method.

For more info, see [AnalyserNode.minDecibels](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AnalyserNode/minDecibels).

*minDecibels* defaults to **-85** and *maxDecibels* defaults to **-25**.

### `maxFreq` *number*
### `minFreq` *number*

Highest and lowest frequencies represented in the X-axis of the analyzer. Values in Hertz.

The minimum allowed value is **1**. Trying to set a lower value will throw an `ERR_FREQUENCY_TOO_LOW` [error](#custom-errors).

The maximum practical value is half the sampling rate ([`audioCtx.sampleRate`](#audioctx-audiocontext-object-read-only)), although this is not enforced by **audioMotion-analyzer**.

It is preferable to use the [`setFreqRange()`](#setfreqrange-minfreq-maxfreq-) method and set both values at once, to prevent `minFreq` being higher than the current `maxFreq` or vice-versa at a given moment.

*minFreq* defaults to **20** and *maxFreq* defaults to **22000**.

### `mirror` *number*

*Available since v3.3.0*

Horizontal mirroring effect. Valid values are:

mirror | Effect
:-----:|--------
-1     | Mirrors the analyzer to the left (low frequencies at the center of the screen)
0      | Disables mirror effect (default)
1      | Mirrors the analyzer to the right (high frequencies at the center of the screen)

**Note:** when [`radial`](#radial-boolean) is **_true_**, both `1` and `-1` will produce the same effect.

Defaults to **0**.

### `mode` *number*

Current visualization mode.

+ **Discrete** mode provides the highest resolution, allowing you to visualize individual frequencies amplitudes as provided by the [FFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) computation;
+ **Octave bands** modes display wider vertical bars, each one representing the *n*th part of an octave, based on a [24-tone equal tempered scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter_tone);
+ **Graph** mode uses the discrete data points to draw a continuous line and/or filled area graph (see [`fillAlpha`](#fillalpha-number) and [`lineWidth`](#linewidth-number) properties).

mode | description | notes
------:|:-------------:|------
0 | Discrete frequencies |
1 | 1/24th octave bands |
2 | 1/12th octave bands |
3 | 1/8th octave bands |
4 | 1/6th octave bands |
5 | 1/4th octave bands |
6 | 1/3rd octave bands |
7 | Half octave bands |
8 | Full octave bands |
9 | *(not valid)* | *reserved*
10 | Graph | *added in v1.1.0*

Defaults to **0**.

### `outlineBars` *boolean*

*Available since v3.6.0*

When *true* and [`mode`](#mode-number) is set to one of the **octave bands** modes, draws outlined bars with customizable [`fillAlpha`](#fillalpha-number) and [`lineWidth`](#linewidth-number).

For effect priority when combined with other settings, see [`isOutlineBars`](#isoutlinebars-boolean-read-only).

Defaults to **false**.

### `overlay` *boolean*

*Available since v2.2.0*

Allows the analyzer to be displayed over other content, by making the canvas background transparent, when set to *true*.

When [`showBgColor`](#showbgcolor-boolean) is also *true*, [`bgAlpha`](#bgalpha-number) controls the background opacity.

Defaults to **false**.

?> In order to keep elements other than the canvas visible in fullscreen, you'll need to set the [`fsElement`](#fselement-htmlelement-object) property in the [constructor](#constructor) options.

### `peakEnergy` **(DEPRECATED)**

**This property will be removed in version 4.0.0** - Use [`getEnergy('peak')`](#getenergy-preset-startfreq-endfreq-) instead.

### `pixelRatio` *number* *(Read only)*

Current [devicePixelRatio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/devicePixelRatio).
This is usually **1** for standard displays and **2** for retina / Hi-DPI screens.

You can refer to this value to adjust any additional drawings done in the canvas (via [callback function](#oncanvasdraw-function)).

When [`loRes`](#lores-boolean) is *true* `pixelRatio` is halved, i.e. **0.5** for standard displays and **1** for retina / Hi-DPI.

### `radial` *boolean*

*Available since v2.4.0*

When *true*, the spectrum analyzer is rendered as a circle, with radial frequency bars spreading from the center of the canvas.

When radial mode is active, [`ledBars`](#ledbars-boolean) and [`lumiBars`](#lumibars-boolean) have no effect, and
also [`showPeaks`](#showpeaks-boolean) has no effect in radial **Graph** mode.

See also [`spinSpeed`](#spinspeed-number).

Defaults to **false**.

!> [See related known issue](#alphabars-and-fillalpha-wont-work-with-radial-on-firefox)

### `reflexAlpha` *number*

*Available since v2.1.0*

Reflection opacity (when [`reflexRatio`](#reflexratio-number) > 0).

It must be a number between 0 (completely transparent) and 1 (completely opaque).

Defaults to **0.15**.

### `reflexBright` *number*

*Available since v2.3.0*

Reflection brightness (when [`reflexRatio`](#reflexratio-number) > 0).

It must be a number. Values below 1 darken the reflection and above 1 make it brighter.
A value of 0 will render the reflected image completely black, while a value of 1 will preserve the original brightness.

Defaults to **1**.

!> [See related known issue](#reflexbright-wont-work-on-some-browsers)

### `reflexFit` *boolean*

*Available since v2.1.0*

When *true*, the reflection will be adjusted (stretched or shrinked) to fit the canvas. If set to *false* the reflected image may be cut at the bottom (when [`reflexRatio`](#reflexratio-number) < 0.5) or not fill the entire canvas (when [`reflexRatio`](#reflexratio-number) > 0.5).

Defaults to **true**.

### `reflexRatio` *number*

*Available since v2.1.0*

Percentage of canvas height used for reflection. It must be a number greater than or equal to 0, and less than 1. Trying to set a value out of this range will throw an `ERR_REFLEX_OUT_OF_RANGE` [error](#custom-errors).

For a perfect mirrored effect, set `reflexRatio` to 0.5 and both [`reflexAlpha`](#reflexalpha-number) and [`reflexBright`](#reflexbright-number) to 1.

This has no effect when [`lumiBars`](#lumibars-boolean) is *true*.

Defaults to **0** (no reflection).

### `showBgColor` *boolean*

Determines whether the canvas background should be painted.

If ***true***, the background color defined by the current gradient will be used.
Opacity can be adjusted via [`bgAlpha`](#bgalpha-number) property, when [`overlay`](#overlay-boolean) is ***true***.

If ***false***, the canvas background will be painted black when [`overlay`](#overlay-boolean) is ***false***,
or transparent when [`overlay`](#overlay-boolean) is ***true***.

Defaults to **true**.

?> Please note that when [`overlay`](#overlay-boolean) is ***false*** and [`ledBars`](#ledbars-boolean) is ***true***, the background color will always be black,
and setting `showBgColor` to ***true*** will make the "unlit" LEDs visible instead.

### `showFPS` *boolean*

*true* to display the current frame rate. Defaults to **false**.

### `showLeds` **(DEPRECATED)**

**This property will be removed in version 4.0.0** - Use [`ledBars`](#ledbars-boolean) instead.

### `showPeaks` *boolean*

*true* to show amplitude peaks for each frequency. Defaults to **true**.

### `showScaleX` *boolean*

*Available since v3.0.0*

*true* to display the frequency (Hz) scale on the X axis. Defaults to **true**.

*NOTE: this property was named `showScale` in versions prior to v3.0.0*

### `showScaleY` *boolean*

*Available since v2.4.0*

*true* to display the level (dB) scale on the Y axis. Defaults to **false**.

This option has no effect when [`radial`](#radial-boolean) or [`lumiBars`](#lumibars-boolean) are set to *true*.

### `smoothing` *number*

Sets the analyzer's [smoothingTimeConstant](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AnalyserNode/smoothingTimeConstant).

It must be a number between 0 and 1. Lower values make the analyzer respond faster to changes.

Defaults to **0.5**.

### `spinSpeed` *number*

*Available since v2.4.0*

When [`radial`](#radial-boolean) is *true*, this property defines the analyzer rotation speed, in revolutions per minute.

Positive values will make the analyzer rotate clockwise, while negative values will make it rotate counterclockwise. A value of 0 results in no rotation.

Defaults to **0**.

### `splitGradient` *boolean*

*Available since v3.0.0*

When *true*, the gradient will be split between both channels, so each channel will have different colors. If *false*, both channels will use the full gradient.

| splitGradient: *true* | splitGradient: *false* |
|:--:|:--:|
| ![split-on](demo/media/splitGradient_on.png) | ![split-off](demo/media/splitGradient_off.png) |

This option has no effect in horizontal gradients, or when [`stereo`](#stereo-boolean) is set to *false*.

Defaults to **false**.

### `stereo` *boolean*

*Available since v3.0.0*

When *true*, the spectrum analyzer will display separate graphs for the left and right audio channels.

Notes:
- Stereo tracks will always output stereo audio, even if `stereo` is set to *false* (in such case the analyzer graph will represent both channels combined);
- Mono (single channel) tracks will output audio only on the left channel when `stereo` is *true*, unless you have another stereo source simultaneously
connected to the analyzer, which will force the mono source to be upmixed to stereo.

See also [`splitGradient`](#splitgradient-boolean).

Defaults to **false**.

### `useCanvas` *boolean*

*Available since v3.5.0*

When set to *false*, analyzer graphics are not rendered to the [`canvas`](#canvas-htmlcanvaselement-object-read-only).
Setting it to *false* in the [**constructor**](#constructor) options also prevents the canvas from being added to the document/container.

Please note that the analyzer processing runs regardless of the value of `useCanvas` and any callback defined for [`onCanvasDraw`](#oncanvasdraw-function)
will still be triggered on every animation frame, so you can use the [`getBars()`](#getbars) method to create your own visualizations.

If you want to completely stop the audio data processing, see [`toggleAnalyzer()`](#toggleanalyzer-boolean-).

Defaults to **true**.

### `volume` *number*

*Available since v3.0.0*

Read or set the output volume.

A value of **0** (zero) will mute the sound output, while a value of **1** will keep the same input volume.
Higher values can be used to amplify the input, but it may cause distortion.

Please note that changing the audio element volume directly will affect the amplitude of analyzer graphs, while this property does not.

Defaults to **1**.

## Static properties

### `AudioMotionAnalyzer.version` *string* *(Read only)*

*Available since v3.0.0*

Returns the version of the **audioMotion-analyzer** package.

Since this is a static property, you should always access it as `AudioMotionAnalyzer.version` - this allows you to check the package version even before instantiating your object.


## Callback functions

### `onCanvasDraw` *function*

If defined, this function will be called after rendering each frame.

The audioMotion object will be passed as an argument to the callback function.

Canvas properties `fillStyle` and `strokeStyle` will be set to the current gradient when the function is called.

Usage example:

```js
const audioMotion = new AudioMotionAnalyzer(
    document.getElementById('container'),
    {
        source: document.getElementById('audio'),
        onCanvasDraw: drawCallback
    }
);

function drawCallback( instance ) {
	const ctx      = instance.canvasCtx,
    	  baseSize = ( instance.isFullscreen ? 40 : 20 ) * instance.pixelRatio;

    // use the 'energy' value to increase the font size and make the logo pulse to the beat
    ctx.font = `${ baseSize + instance.getEnergy() * 25 * instance.pixelRatio }px Orbitron, sans-serif`;

    ctx.fillStyle = '#fff8';
    ctx.textAlign = 'center';
    ctx.fillText( 'audioMotion', instance.canvas.width - baseSize * 8, baseSize * 2 );
}
```

For more examples, see the fluid demo [source code](https://github.com/hvianna/audioMotion-analyzer/blob/master/demo/fluid.js) or [this pen](https://codepen.io/hvianna/pen/LYZwdvG).

### `onCanvasResize` *function*

If defined, this function will be called whenever the canvas is resized.

Two arguments are passed: a string with the reason why the function was called (see below) and the audioMotion object.

Reason | Description
-------|------------
`'create'` | canvas created by the **audioMotion-analyzer** [constructor](#constructor)
`'fschange'` | analyzer entered or left fullscreen mode
`'lores'` | [low resolution option](#lores-boolean) toggled on or off
`'resize'` | browser window or canvas container element were resized
`'user'` | canvas dimensions changed by user script, via [`height`](#height-number) and [`width`](#width-number) properties, [`setCanvasSize()`](#setcanvassize-width-height-) or [`setOptions()`](#setoptions-options-) methods

?> As of [version 2.5.0](https://github.com/hvianna/audioMotion-analyzer/releases/tag/2.5.0), the `'resize'` reason is no longer sent on fullscreen changes and
the callback is triggered only when canvas dimensions *effectively* change from the previous state.

Usage example:

```js
const audioMotion = new AudioMotionAnalyzer(
    document.getElementById('container'),
    {
        source: document.getElementById('audio'),
        onCanvasResize: ( reason, instance ) => {
            console.log( `[${reason}] canvas size is: ${instance.canvas.width} x ${instance.canvas.height}` );
        }
    }
);
```

## Methods

### `connectInput( source )`

*Available since v3.0.0*

Connects an [HTMLMediaElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement) or an [AudioNode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioNode)
(or any of its descendants) to the analyzer.

If `source` is an *HTMLMediaElement*, the method returns a [MediaElementAudioSourceNode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaElementAudioSourceNode) created
for that element; if `source` is an *AudioNode* instance, it returns the `source` object itself; if it's neither an [ERR_INVALID_AUDIO_SOURCE](#custom-errors) error is thrown.

See also [`disconnectInput()`](#disconnectinput-node-) and [`connectedSources`](#connectedsources-array-read-only).

### `connectOutput( [node] )`

*Available since v3.0.0*

This method allows connecting the analyzer **output** to other audio processing modules that use the Web Audio API.

`node` must be an [*AudioNode*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioNode) instance.

By default, the analyzer is connected to the speakers upon instantiation, unless you set [`connectSpeakers: false`](#connectspeakers-boolean) in the constructor options.

See also [`disconnectOutput()`](#disconnectoutput-node-) and [`connectedTo`](#connectedto-array-read-only).

?> If called with no argument, analyzer output is connected to the speakers (the *AudioContext* `destination` node).

### `disconnectInput( [node] )`

*Available since v3.0.0*

Disconnects audio source nodes previously connected to the analyzer.

`node` may be an *AudioNode* instance or an **array** of such objects.

Please note that if you have connected an `<audio>` or `<video>` element, you should disconnect the respective [MediaElementAudioSourceNode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaElementAudioSourceNode)
created for it.

See also [`connectInput()`](#connectinput-source-).

?> If called with no argument, all connected sources are disconnected.

### `disconnectOutput( [node] )`

*Available since v3.0.0*

Disconnects the analyzer output from previously connected audio nodes.

`node` must be a connected *AudioNode*.

See also [`connectOutput()`](#connectoutput-node-).

?> If called with no argument, analyzer output is disconnected from all nodes, **including the speakers!**

### `getBars()`

*Available since v3.5.0*

Returns an array with current data for each analyzer bar. Each array element is an object with the format below:

```js
{
	posX: <number>,   // horizontal position of this bar on the canvas
	freqLo: <number>, // starting frequency for this bar
	freqHi: <number>, // ending frequency for this bar
	peak: <array>,    // peak values for left and right channels
	hold: <array>,    // peak hold frames for left and right channels - values < 0 mean the peak is falling down
	value: <array>    // current amplitude on left and right channels
}
```

`peak` and `value` elements are floats between 0 and 1, relative to the lowest and highest volume levels defined by [`minDecibels`](#mindecibels-number) and [`maxDecibels`](#maxdecibels-number).

`hold` values are integers and indicate the hold time (in frames) for the current peak. The maximum value is 30 and means the peak has just been set, while negative values mean the peak is currently falling down.

Please note that `hold` and `value` will have only one element when [`stereo`](#stereo-boolean) is *false*, but `peak` is always a two-element array.

You can use this method to create your own visualizations using the analyzer data. See [this pen](https://codepen.io/hvianna/pen/ZEKWWJb) for usage example.

### `getEnergy( [preset | startFreq], [endFreq] )`

*Available since v3.2.0*

Returns a number between 0 and 1, representing the amplitude of a specific frequency, or the average energy of a frequency range.

**If called with no parameters, it returns the overall spectrum energy** obtained by the average of amplitudes of the *currently displayed frequency bands*.

Preset strings are available for predefined ranges plus the "peak" functionality (see table below), or you can specify the desired frequency and an optional ending frequency for a range.
Frequency values must be specified in Hz.

preset    | description
----------|-------------
'peak'    | peak overall energy value of the last 30 frames (approximately 0.5s)
'bass'    | average energy between 20 and 250 Hz
'lowMid'  | average energy between 250 and 500 Hz
'mid'     | average energy between 500 and 2000 Hz
'highMid' | average energy between 2000 and 4000 Hz
'treble'  | average energy between 4000 and 16000 Hz

Please note that preset names are case-sensitive. If the specified preset is not recognized the method will return *null*.

Use this method inside your callback function to create additional visual effects. See the [fluid demo](/demo/fluid.html) or [this pen](https://codepen.io/hvianna/pen/poNmVYo) for examples.


### `registerGradient( name, options )`

Registers a custom color gradient.

`name` must be a non-empty *string* that will be used when setting the [`gradient`](#gradient-string) property. `options` must be an object as shown below:

```js
const options = {
    bgColor: '#011a35', // background color (optional) - defaults to '#111'
    dir: 'h',           // add this property to create a horizontal gradient (optional)
    colorStops: [       // list your gradient colors in this array (at least 2 entries are required)
        'red',                      // colors may be defined in any valid CSS format
        { pos: .6, color: '#ff0' }, // use an object to adjust the position (0 to 1) of a color
        'hsl( 120, 100%, 50% )'     // colors may be defined in any valid CSS format
    ]
}

audioMotion.registerGradient( 'my-grad', options );
```

Additional information about [gradient color-stops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasGradient/addColorStop).

### `setCanvasSize( width, height )`

Sets the analyzer nominal dimensions in pixels. See [`height`](#height-number) and [`width`](#width-number) properties for details.

### `setFreqRange( minFreq, maxFreq )`

Sets the desired frequency range. Values are expressed in Hz (Hertz).

### `setLedParams( [params] )`

*Available since v3.2.0*

Customize parameters used to create the [LEDs display effect](#ledbars-boolean).

`params` should be an object with the following structure:

```js
const params = {
    maxLeds: 128, // integer, > 0
    spaceV: 1,    // > 0
    spaceH: .5    // >= 0
}
```

property  | description
----------|-------------
`maxLeds` | maximum desired number of LED elements per analyzer bar
`spaceV`  | vertical spacing ratio, relative to the LED height (**1** means spacing is the same as the LED height)
`spaceH`  | **minimum** horizontal spacing ratio, relative to the available width (**0.5** means half of the width is used for spacing and half for the LED); behaves exactly like [barSpace](#barspace-number) (values >= 1 are considered as literal pixel values) and will override it if larger

The available canvas height is initially divided by `maxLeds` and vertical spacing is calculated observing the `spaceV` ratio;
if necessary, the led count is decreased until both the led segment and the vertical spacing are at least 2px tall.

You can try different values in the [fluid demo](https://audiomotion.dev/demo/fluid.html).

**If called with no arguments or any invalid property, disables previously set parameters.**

### `setOptions( [options] )`

Shorthand method for setting several analyzer [properties](#properties) at once.

See **[Options object](#options-object)** for object structure and default values.

?> If called with no argument (or `options` is *undefined*), resets all configuration options to their default values.

### `setSensitivity( minDecibels, maxDecibels )`

Adjust the analyzer's sensitivity. See [`minDecibels`](#mindecibels-number) and [`maxDecibels`](#maxdecibels-number) properties.

### `toggleAnalyzer( [boolean] )`

Starts (*true*) or stops (*false*) the analyzer process. If no argument provided, inverts the current status.

Returns the resulting status.

The analyzer is started by default after initialization, unless you specify [`start: false`](#start-boolean) in the [constructor](#constructor) options.
When the analyzer is off, no audio data is processed and no callbacks to [`onCanvasDraw`](#oncanvasdraw-function) will be triggered.

See also [`isOn`](#ison-boolean-read-only) property.

### `toggleFullscreen()`

Toggles fullscreen mode on / off.

By default, only the canvas is sent to fullscreen.
You can set the [`fsElement`](#fselement-htmlelement-object) constructor option to a parent container, to keep desired interface elements visible during fullscreen.

?> Fullscreen requests must be triggered by user action, like a key press or mouse click, so you must call this method from within a user-generated event handler.


## Custom Errors

*Available since v2.0.0*

**audioMotion-analyzer** uses a custom error object to throw errors for some critical operations.

The `code` property is a string label that can be checked to identify the specific error in a reliable way.

code                       | Error description
---------------------------|--------------------
ERR_AUDIO_CONTEXT_FAIL     | Could not create audio context. The user agent may lack support for the Web Audio API.
ERR_INVALID_AUDIO_CONTEXT  | [Audio context](#audioctx-audiocontext-object-read-only) provided by user is not valid.
ERR_INVALID_AUDIO_SOURCE   | Audio source provided in [`source`](#source-htmlmediaelement-or-audionode-object) option or [`connectInput()`](#connectinput-source-) method is not an instance of HTMLMediaElement or AudioNode.
ERR_INVALID_MODE           | User tried to set the visualization [`mode`](#mode-number) to an invalid value.
ERR_FREQUENCY_TOO_LOW      | User tried to set the [`minFreq`](#minfreq-number) or [`maxFreq`](#maxfreq-number) properties to a value lower than 1.
ERR_GRADIENT_INVALID_NAME  | The `name` parameter for [`registerGradient()`](#registergradient-name-options-) must be a non-empty string.
ERR_GRADIENT_NOT_AN_OBJECT | The `options` parameter for [`registerGradient()`](#registergradient-name-options-) must be an object.
ERR_GRADIENT_MISSING_COLOR | The `options` parameter for [`registerGradient()`](#registergradient-name-options-) must define at least two color-stops.
ERR_REFLEX_OUT_OF_RANGE    | Tried to assign a value < 0 or >= 1 to [`reflexRatio`](#reflexratio-number) property.
ERR_UNKNOWN_GRADIENT       | User tried to [select a gradient](#gradient-string) not previously registered.


## Known Issues

### reflexBright won't work on some browsers {docsify-ignore}

[`reflexBright`](#reflexbright-number) feature relies on the [`filter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/filter) property of the Canvas API,
which is [currently not supported in some browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=mdn-api_canvasrenderingcontext2d_filter) (notably, Opera and Safari).

### alphaBars and fillAlpha won't work with Radial on Firefox {docsify-ignore}

On Firefox, [`alphaBars`](#alphaBars-boolean) and [`fillAlpha`](#fillalpha-number) won't work with [`radial`](#radial-boolean) visualization when using hardware acceleration, due to [this bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1164912).

### Visualization of live streams won't work on Safari {docsify-ignore}

Safari's implementation of Web Audio won't return analyzer data for live streams, as documented in [this bug report](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=195043).
